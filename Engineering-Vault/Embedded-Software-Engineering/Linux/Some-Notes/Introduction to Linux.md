# History of Linux
The history of Linux is pretty closely tied to the history of computers in general. However, before we get to Linux, we must know what came before, and that is UNIX.
## Unix
Unix is an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Denis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs, who also invented the C programming language. Unix was very flexible and efficient. Unix used the bourne-shell which was the basis for GNU-Linux's bourne-again-shell (BASH). 
Unix became very popular among academics. Later on as Unix grew in popularity, several operating systems were derived from Unix. Several vendors tried to create commercial Unix derived operating systems, but AT&T owned the copyright to the Unix name. This period was known as the Unix wars. 
## GNU and Open-Source
During the Unix-wars, many academics wanted to keep using a Unix-like operating system as well as Unix applications. Unwilling to pay for said software, a Richard Stallman founded the GNU project, which was a recursive acronym that meant GNU's-Not-Unix (GNU). The GNU Project was an open-source project intended to create free software. The GNU project aimed to recreate Unix software. The GNU project successfully created a collection of Unix based software but lacked a kernel to make a complete operating system. 

## Just For Fun
Linus Torvalds was a student at the University of Helsinki when he decided to start an operating system project that was "just for fun". In 1991 Linus Torvalds posted on a Minix group saying he's building a free operating system as a hobby project, this project grew to have many contributors until Linux was born. Initially, Linus Torvalds wanted the name of the kernel to be FREAX, but one of the admins for the project did not like this name and instead changed it to Linux. With this, Linux integrated with the GNU project and became what is today GNU-Linux.

# What is Linux?
Linux is an open-source Unix based kernel with several distributions that are based on it. This spawns a Linux family of operating systems with different flavors/distros like Debian, Fedora, and (i use)Arch(btw). Linux is one of the most popular operating systems in the world and is mostly used in servers or in embedded devices. Linux is also popular as a desktop platform, but it is still a niche preference compared to a Windows desktop. However, it seems that the Linux desktop is also on the rise, with Valve making notable contributions to Linux gaming.

## Open-Source Legacy
The impact of Linux on computing is more than just its kernel. Linux has profoundly influenced the computing landscape with its open-source legacy. Despite being the most popular operating system, Linux is free and open-source, and allowing everyone to replicate, modify, and distribute the Linux kernel without a restrictive license. This culture of open-source fosters collaboration across the computing world, and has brought to us many other great software free of charge.
